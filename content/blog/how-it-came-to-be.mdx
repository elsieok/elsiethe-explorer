Ok, so first I'm going to explain the name. ElsieThe Explorer has two roots, one in Dora the Explorer because she explores and so do I, and another in the infamous Internet Explorer. Count how many letters are in elsiethe and internet. Pretty neat coincidence right? Consider this a personal browser that hold the pages of my life.

Now for the actual website itself. Some time ago I spoke with one on my professors at Pomona, Professor Jingyi Li. They have a really cool website [jingyi.me](https://jingyi.me) and I wanted to know what they used to build it, which was [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. It's super easy to use and I originally started with this to build my blog however I decided that for now I wanted a more hands-on experience.

Now for the boring part: I built this blog using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) as the main framework, which provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and performance optimizations out of the box. The frontend is powered by [React](https://react.dev), which allowed me to use a component-based architecture for building the user interface.
For content management, I chose next-mdx-remote to handle my blog posts written in MDX format. This allows me to write in Markdown while seamlessly embedding React components when needed. The gray-matter library processes the frontmatter in my posts, extracting metadata like titles, dates, and tags from the top of each file.
The styling is handled by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) with the Typography plugin, which provides some pretty nice default styling for all my markdown content through the prose classes, without having to write write custom CSS. For date formatting throughout the site, I use date-fns to handle parsing and displaying dates in a user-friendly format.

Some things I struggled with were designing and styling; this blog is very basic right now but as time progresses I will be adding to and improving it bit by bit, and rendering posts/project content. For some reason I could NOT get my Client component to work. MDX files are transpiled to executable javascript via serialize() and MDXRemote renders it (they are from the same package 'next-mdx-remote'). serialize() is a server-side function while MDXRemote can run on either server or client (in this case, it's on the client-side). The fixes were simple (literally just using async functions correctly), but the process of figuring it out was finicky. The main issue was that my blog code and project code use almost identical scripts and that caused me to miss small problems what I hadn't explicitly understand/researched. I definitely could've been more efficient but hey ho, that's just how it goes. The frustration I felt will forever remind me to slow down and digest everything I'm utilising. Don't just read the documentation for the tools you're using, read the documentaton for the tools that those tools rely on, google definitions, try and figure out why a tool has been implemented in that specific way. Ask a million and one questions and don't feel guilty about it. This will save you many headaches in the future.

Anyway, as I mentioned earlier, this is not my blog's final form. It's just a baby right now and it will continue to grow into something awesome. So I thank you for joining me on this journey and please check-in regularly! Hopefully you will see something that piques your interest.
